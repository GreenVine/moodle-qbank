## Moodle QBank (Question Bank)
### Introduction
This is a full-screen question bank editor for famous learning management system (LMS), Moodle. Use it as a plug-in to quickly edit questions without the need to navigate between multiple pages.

### Installation
Upload the plug-in and access to the editor using: `http://moodleurl/mod/qbankeditor`.

To prettify the URL, use the supplied `.htaccess` on your Apache installation. You will need to suffix all URLs including API endpoints with **.php** if `.htaccess` is not supported.

### Compatibility
Fully tested on Moodle open source version 3.2.2.

### Known Issue
Some features, such as beeping question support, should be used combined with another Moodle plug-in which will be open-sourced soon.
